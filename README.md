# RestaurantTech Insights: From Database Design to Visual Analytics

## Hyperspace

In this post, I present the culmination of my efforts during the Meta Certificate program, providing an overview of my capstone project.

### Roadmap

Here is the roadmap followed in this project:

1. **Version Control**
    - Establishment of a repository/local directory for code storage.
    - Thorough documentation and tracking of system modifications.
    - Collaborative access to enhance the codebase.

2. **Database Setup in MySQL Workbench**
    - Setting up the MySQL instance server.
    - Creating an Entity Relationship Model.
    - Implementation of the ER diagram data model in MySQL.

3. **Database API Development**
    - Creating virtual tables, stored procedures, and prepared statements for Little Lemon restaurant.
    - Adding query functions.

4. **Utilizing Tableau for Data Analysis**
    - Assisting Little Lemon in generating insights using data analysis features.

### Version Control

Version control is fundamental for managing modifications in software development and collaborative projects. In this project, tasks included:

- Creating a centralized location for code storage.
- Documenting and tracking all system modifications.
- Providing collaborative access for codebase enhancement.

### Database Design and Implementation

Little Lemon required a reliable relational database system to manage data efficiently. The project encompassed:

- Utilizing MySQL Workbench for a robust database system.
- Creating an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram to represent database structure and relationships.
- Exploring various data models for specific objectives.

### Database Operations

Several database operations were conducted, including:

- Creation of a virtual table named OrdersView focusing on specific criteria.
- Development of procedures like GetMaxQuantity(), MakeBooking(), CheckBooking(), CancelBooking(), and UpdateBooking().

### Data Visualization with Tableau

The next step involved visualizing restaurant sales data and implementing a Python database client. Objectives included:

- Data visualization using appropriate tools and techniques.
- Development of a Python database client for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis.

### Data Analytics with Tableau

Diving into data analytics using Tableau, insights were presented using worksheets and interactive dashboards:

### Conclusion

The use of Tableau's powerful tools allowed for uncovering meaningful patterns and trends in the restaurant's data. This project has been a journey of discovery and understanding, offering valuable insights through visual representations. Thank you for engaging with this exploration. Feel free to share any further questions or thoughts.

With enhanced visual insights, this project concludes. Thank you once again for your participation.
